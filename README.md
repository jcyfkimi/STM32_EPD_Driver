# STM32_EPD_Driver
This is a project for driving the ePaper display panel with STM32, here I'm using the development board from Good Display's DESPI-M02, which is based on STM32F103VET6 microcontroller. 

# Hardware connections
| DESPI-M02 | EPD |
|----|----|
| PE13 | EPD_BUSY |
| PE14 | EPD_RES |
| PE15 | EPD_DC |
| PD8 | EPD_CS |
| PD9 | EPD_SCK |
| PD10 | EPD_SDI |
